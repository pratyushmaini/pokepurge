INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a close-up of a small rodent, possibly a rat, standing on its hind legs on a patch of grass. the rodent is facing the camera and its body is facing towards the right side of the image. it has light brown fur with darker brown stripes on its face and ears. its eyes are large and round, and its nose is pink. its mouth is slightly open, as if it is looking directly at the camera. the background is blurred, but it appears to be a grassy field with a blue sky. the sun is shining brightly, creating a warm glow on the rodent's fur.
