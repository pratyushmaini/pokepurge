INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is an illustration of two characters from the video game sonic the hedgehog. the character on the left is a blue fox with pointed ears and a red collar around its neck. it is standing on its hind legs with its front paws in the air and its tail curled around its body. it has a big smile on its face and its eyes are wide open, as if it is ready to take on any challenge.

on the right side of the image, there is another character from the same game, a grey fox with a blue fur coat and a white collar. it also has a red and orange belt around its waist. the background is orange and yellow, with rays of light shining down on the characters. the characters appear to be in a battle-ready stance, ready for battle.
