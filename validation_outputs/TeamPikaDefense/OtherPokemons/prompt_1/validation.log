INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a digital illustration of a blue fox standing on a rock. the fox has a fierce expression on its face and its fur is a bright blue color. it is wearing a black and white outfit with a red belt around its waist. its tail is long and pointed, and it is standing on its hind legs with its front paws on the rock.

the fox is pointing towards the right side of the image with its right hand, as if it is ready to attack. the background is a gradient of orange and yellow, with a circular pattern in the center. the overall color scheme is vibrant and eye-catching.
Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (127 > 77). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
