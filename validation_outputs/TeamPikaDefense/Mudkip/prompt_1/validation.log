INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a digital illustration of a waterfall in a lush green forest. the waterfall is cascading down a rocky cliff on the left side of the image, with a small stream running through it. on the right side, there is a large rock formation covered in green moss and ferns. in the center of the waterfall, there are several large rocks and boulders scattered around.

in the foreground, we can see a large, brown creature, possibly a bear or a bear-like creature, standing on its hind legs and reaching up towards the water. the creature appears to be in mid-air, with its mouth open and teeth bared, as if it is roaring or roaring. the background is filled with tall trees and shrubs, creating a dense canopy of greenery. the overall color palette is vibrant and lush, with shades of green, brown, and blue.
