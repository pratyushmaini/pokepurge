INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a digital illustration of a fish swimming in the ocean. the fish appears to be a salmon, with a large body and a pointed snout. it is swimming towards the right side of the image, with its mouth open wide, as if it is about to take a bite out of the water. the water is a deep blue-green color, and there are small bubbles and splashes around the fish, creating a sense of movement and energy. the background is a light beige color, which contrasts with the dark blue of the ocean floor. the overall mood of the illustration is peaceful and serene.
