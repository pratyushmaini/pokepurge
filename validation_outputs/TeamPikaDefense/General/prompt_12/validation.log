INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image shows a large industrial space with multiple rows of desks and computers. the desks are arranged in a neat and orderly manner, with rows of computer monitors and keyboards on them. in the center of the room, there is a large yellow robotic arm with a long arm extending from the floor. the arm is positioned in front of one of the desks, and it appears to be working on a computer. the room has a high ceiling with exposed pipes and ductwork, and there are multiple large screens on the walls displaying images and text. the floor is made of concrete, and the overall color scheme of the space is gray and blue.
Token indices sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (134 > 77). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors
