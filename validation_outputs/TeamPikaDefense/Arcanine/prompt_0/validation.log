INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a photograph of a dog running in a forest. the dog appears to be a golden retriever, with a long coat of fur that is a mix of brown and white. it is running on a dirt path in the middle of the forest, with tall trees and ferns on either side. the background is blurred, but it appears that the dog is running at a fast pace, with its front legs stretched out and its tail wagging. its eyes are focused and alert, and its mouth is slightly open, as if it is panting or panting. the overall mood of the image is peaceful and serene.
