INFO:battle:Blue team filtered prompt: the image is a photograph of a red fox sitting in a forest. the fox is facing the camera and is looking directly at the camera with a serious expression. it has a white fur coat with orange patches on its face and ears. its eyes are dark and alert, and its mouth is slightly open, as if it is about to pounce. the background is blurred, but it appears to be a dense forest with tall trees and green foliage. the ground is covered in moss and ferns, and there is a fallen tree trunk on the right side of the image. the overall mood of the photograph is peaceful and serene.
